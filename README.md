#### **2. Diabetes or Kidney Disease**
**Signs:** Drinking tons of water, weight loss, or sudden lethargy.

#### **3. Arthritis (Senior Cats)**
**Signs:** Avoiding high-sided litter boxes or crying while climbing.

## Behavioral Triggers: Stress, Secrets, and Solutions

### Is Your Cat Mad at You? Nope—Here’s What’s Really Going On
Cats are emotional ninjas. Cat peeing on carpets often means:

- **Stress:** New pet? Loud noises? Construction? Cats hate change.
- **Territory Wars:** Unneutered males mark turf. Even spayed females do it if they feel threatened.

### **Fix It Fast:**
- **Feliway Diffusers:** Plug these into pee zones—they release calming cat pheromones.
- **Neutering/Spaying:** Reduces marking by 90% in unaltered cats.

**Real-Life Fix:**
> My neighbor’s cat, Luna, started urinating outside the litter box after their dog arrived. A $30 Feliway diffuser + separate feeding zones stopped the chaos in days!

## Litter Box Fixes: The Golden Rules

### Your Cat’s Toilet Pet Peeves (And How to Fix Them!)
Imagine using a dirty, cramped bathroom. That’s how your cat feels!

#### **The 3 Golden Rules:**
1. **One litter box per cat + one extra.**
2. **Clean daily.** Scoop poop, replace litter weekly.
3. **Ditch scented litters.** They smell like chemical warfare to cats.

### **For Senior Cats:**
- Use low-entry boxes (like the **PetFusion BetterBox**).
- Place litter boxes on every floor (arthritis makes stairs painful).

### **For Kittens:**
- Use shallow trays (try the **Nature’s Miracle Kitten Litter Pan**).
- Choose **unscented, clumping litter** (their noses are sensitive!).
